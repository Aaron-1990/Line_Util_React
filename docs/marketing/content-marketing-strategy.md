## Part 3: Blog Post Ideas with Outlines

### Blog Post 1: The Hidden Cost of Spreadsheet-Based Capacity Planning

**Funnel Stage:** Awareness
**Target Persona:** IE Manager, Plant Manager
**Target Keyword:** "capacity planning spreadsheet problems"
**Word Count:** 1,200-1,500

**Outline:**

```
HOOK (2-3 sentences)
Every manufacturing plant has THE spreadsheet. The one with 47 tabs, circular
references, and formulas that only one person understands. Here is what that
spreadsheet is actually costing you.

SECTION 1: The Time Cost
- Average time for annual capacity plan: 40+ hours
- Time for scenario analysis: Another 8-16 hours each
- Multiply by frequency of business changes
- Calculation: IE hourly rate x hours = direct cost

SECTION 2: The Accuracy Cost
- Manual data entry errors (studies show 1-5% error rate)
- Formula mistakes (hidden, compounding)
- Stale data (plan obsolete within weeks)
- Real example: A 2% error in cycle time compounds to 20% capacity error

SECTION 3: The Opportunity Cost
- Scenarios NOT run because they take too long
- Business NOT quoted because capacity unknown
- Decisions delayed waiting for analysis
- The cost of a wrong decision vs. a delayed decision

SECTION 4: The Knowledge Cost
- Tribal knowledge locked in one person's head
- What happens when they leave?
- No audit trail for decisions
- Organizational risk

SECTION 5: The Alternative
- Modern capacity planning (brief, not sales pitch)
- What good looks like: 17ms optimization, unlimited scenarios
- Transition is easier than you think

CONCLUSION
The spreadsheet feels free because IT costs nothing. But it is the most
expensive tool in your plant. The question is not whether you can afford
to change - it is whether you can afford not to.

### Blog Post 2: Why Your Capacity Plan Is Wrong by Q2

**Funnel Stage:** Awareness
**Target Persona:** Industrial Engineer
**Target Keyword:** "capacity planning accuracy"
**Word Count:** 1,000-1,200

**Outline:**

```
HOOK
You spend December building the perfect capacity plan. By February, it is
already wrong. Here is why that keeps happening - and what to do about it.

SECTION 1: The Annual Planning Fallacy
- Plans assume static demand (demand changes monthly)
- OEM volume adjustments
- Program delays and accelerations
- New business opportunities

SECTION 2: Data Decay
- Cycle times drift
- Efficiency changes
- New models added, old ones sunset
- Your data is a snapshot of a moving target

SECTION 3: The "Big Excel" Problem
- Too complex to update easily
- Updates break formulas
- Nobody wants to touch it
- So it just... sits there, getting more wrong

SECTION 4: The Frequency Solution
- Best-in-class plants plan continuously
- Every volume change triggers re-analysis
- Scenario analysis becomes a habit, not an event
- This requires speed (which spreadsheets cannot provide)

SECTION 5: Practical Steps
- Simplify your planning model
- Automate data inputs where possible
- Plan monthly, not annually
- Invest in tools that enable speed

CONCLUSION
The goal is not a perfect plan. The goal is a good-enough plan you can
update when reality changes. That requires a different approach.

### Blog Post 3: The Industrial Engineer's Guide to Constraint Identification

**Funnel Stage:** Awareness / Consideration
**Target Persona:** Industrial Engineer
**Target Keyword:** "manufacturing constraint identification"
**Word Count:** 1,500-2,000

**Outline:**

```
HOOK
Every plant has a constraint. Most plants are working on the wrong one.
Here is how to find your true bottleneck.

SECTION 1: Theory of Constraints Basics
- Eli Goldratt's The Goal (brief summary)
- System output is determined by the constraint
- Optimizing non-constraints is waste

SECTION 2: The Utilization Trap
- High utilization does not mean constraint
- Utilization vs. throughput
- The line at 100% with buffer before it: Is it the constraint?

SECTION 3: Constraint Identification Methods
- Method 1: Where does inventory accumulate?
- Method 2: What determines your lead time?
- Method 3: What limits your ability to say "yes" to new business?
- Method 4: Data-driven utilization analysis

SECTION 4: Per-Area Processing
- Why you must analyze each area independently
- Products flow through ALL areas sequentially
- The constraint moves as product mix changes

SECTION 5: Dynamic Constraints
- Your constraint changes with demand mix
- A line bottlenecked today may not be tomorrow
- Scenario analysis reveals this

SECTION 6: Practical Application
- Pareto analysis of unfulfilled demand
- Heat map of utilization by area
- Timeline view of constraint shifts

CONCLUSION
Finding the constraint is not a one-time exercise. It is a continuous
practice that changes as your business changes.

### Blog Post 4: Changeover Time - The Silent Capacity Killer

**Funnel Stage:** Awareness
**Target Persona:** Industrial Engineer, CI Manager
**Target Keyword:** "changeover time manufacturing"
**Word Count:** 1,200-1,500

**Outline:**

```
HOOK
You have optimized cycle times. You have driven OEE to 85%. But you are
still missing capacity targets. The problem might be hiding between
your products.

SECTION 1: What Is Changeover Time?
- Definition: Time to switch from Model A to Model B
- Includes: Tooling, material, program, verification
- Not just the obvious (also the hidden time)

SECTION 2: The Math Problem
- A 20-model line with 30-minute changeovers
- If you run each model once per day: 10 hours lost
- That is 42% of a 24-hour shift
- Most capacity plans assume this is zero

SECTION 3: Why Changeover Is Hidden
- Not tracked in MES/OEE systems
- Counted as "downtime" (lumped with other losses)
- Varies by model pair (A to B differs from B to A)
- Asymmetric matrices are complex

SECTION 4: The Three-Tier Approach
- Tier 1: Global default (30 minutes baseline)
- Tier 2: Family-to-family defaults (25 values covers 80% of cases)
- Tier 3: Line-specific overrides (only for exceptions)

SECTION 5: SMED and Improvement Prioritization
- Single-Minute Exchange of Die (SMED) basics
- Prioritize by frequency x duration x constraint impact
- The transition that happens 50x/month matters more than 1x/month

SECTION 6: Practical Implementation
- Start with current-state measurement
- Build family matrix first
- Use probability-weighted formula for impact calculation
- Track improvement over time

CONCLUSION
Changeover is the last 10-15% of capacity that most plants have not
captured. It is also the easiest to improve once you measure it.

- Overlapping programs create complexity

SECTION 2: The Multi-Year View
- Why annual planning is insufficient
- Volume forecasts are uncertain but directional
- Early constraint identification enables investment planning
- Capital expenditure lead times (18-24 months)

SECTION 3: Scenario Planning for Programs
- Base case vs. optimistic vs. pessimistic
- "What if we win this program?" analysis
- "What if competitor exits?" analysis
- Decision trees and trigger points

SECTION 4: Investment Justification
- When to add capacity vs. overtime vs. outsource
- ROI calculation for new lines
- Lead time considerations
- Risk of over-investment vs. under-investment

SECTION 5: Corporate vs. Plant Perspective
- Plant: "Can we make this work?"
- Corporate: "Which plant should make this?"
- Multi-plant visibility enables global optimization

SECTION 6: Technology Enablers
- Multi-year data modeling
- Scenario comparison tools
- What-if analysis speed
- Visual timeline of constraints

CONCLUSION
Strategic capacity planning is a competitive advantage. The plants that
win new business are the ones that can answer "yes" with confidence.

### Blog Post 6: The Build vs. Buy Trap in Manufacturing Software

**Funnel Stage:** Consideration
**Target Persona:** IE Manager, IT Director
**Target Keyword:** "build vs buy manufacturing software"
**Word Count:** 1,200-1,500

**Outline:**

```
HOOK
"We can build this ourselves. It is just a spreadsheet with a database."
Famous last words.

SECTION 1: The Appeal of DIY
- "We understand our process better than anyone"
- No vendor lock-in
- Custom to our exact needs
- "It is just a few weeks of development"

SECTION 2: The Hidden Costs
- Development time (always 3x longer than estimated)
- Maintenance burden (who supports it when the dev leaves?)
- Opportunity cost (what else could that person be doing?)
- No roadmap (features stop when development stops)

SECTION 3: The Real Math
- Full cost calculation example
- Developer salary + benefits + overhead
- Ongoing maintenance (20% of initial development annually)
- 3-year TCO comparison

SECTION 4: When Build Makes Sense
- Truly unique process (rare)
- Competitive advantage through IP (rarer)
- Existing internal capability with bandwidth (rarest)
- Even then: Build on top of platforms, not from scratch

SECTION 5: When Buy Makes Sense
- Common industry problem (capacity planning qualifies)
- Vendor has domain expertise
- Continuous improvement is included
- Support and training included

SECTION 6: The Hybrid Approach
- Buy the platform, configure the details
- APIs for integration
- Customization within guardrails

CONCLUSION
The question is not "Can we build this?" The question is "Should we?"
Your competitive advantage is manufacturing products, not building
software.

CTA: Calculate your build vs. buy cost

### Blog Post 7: How to Calculate Manufacturing Capacity (The Right Way)

**Funnel Stage:** Awareness
**Target Persona:** Industrial Engineer
**Target Keyword:** "how to calculate manufacturing capacity"
**Word Count:** 1,500-2,000

**Outline:**

```
HOOK
Capacity calculation seems simple. Time available divided by cycle time.
Except it is not that simple. Here is the complete formula.

SECTION 1: The Basic Formula
- Theoretical capacity = Time available / Cycle time
- Why this is always wrong

SECTION 2: The Efficiency Factor
- OEE components: Availability, Performance, Quality
- Adjusted cycle time = Cycle time / (Efficiency / 100)
- Real example with numbers

SECTION 3: Time Available (Really)
- Calendar time vs. planned production time
- Breaks, shift handoffs, planned maintenance
- Holidays and shutdown periods
- Operations days per year

SECTION 4: Multi-Model Complexity
- Different cycle times per model
- Different efficiencies per model
- The constraint is TIME, not pieces
- Priority-based allocation

SECTION 5: Area-by-Area Processing
- Products flow through ALL areas
- Each area processes FULL demand
- Constraint can be in any area
- Sum across areas for total capacity

SECTION 6: Changeover Impact
- Time lost to transitions
- Probability-weighted calculation
- HHI (Herfindahl-Hirschman Index) for model mix
- Changeover reduces available capacity

SECTION 7: The Complete Formula
- Gross time - Changeover = Net time
- Net time / Adjusted cycle time = Max units per model
- Allocate by priority until constraint reached
- Unfulfilled demand = Total demand - Allocated units

CONCLUSION
The formula matters because the answer drives decisions. Get it wrong,
and you quote business you cannot deliver - or turn away business you
could have won.

SECTION 1: Takt Time Thinking
- Takt time = Available time / Customer demand
- Planning to takt, not to capacity
- The customer sets the pace

SECTION 2: Level Scheduling (Heijunka)
- Why Toyota does not batch
- Mix model production
- Changeover reduction enables leveling
- Capacity is more predictable when leveled

SECTION 3: Pull vs. Push
- Capacity planning in a pull system
- Constraint visibility in kanban
- JIT and capacity implications

SECTION 4: Kaizen Culture
- Continuous capacity improvement
- Small daily gains compound
- Measurement drives improvement

SECTION 5: Application to Western Plants
- You do not need to be Toyota
- Principles apply universally
- Start with visibility

CONCLUSION
Toyota's advantage is not their tools. It is their discipline. But good
tools make discipline easier to maintain.

**Funnel Stage:** Decision
**Target Persona:** IE Manager, IT Director
**Target Keyword:** "capacity planning software migration"
**Word Count:** 1,500-1,800

**Outline:**

```
HOOK
After 13 years of building capacity spreadsheets, I built something better.
Here is the story of that transition.

SECTION 1: The Old Way
- The spreadsheet that grew over years
- 47 tabs, 10,000 rows, 500+ formulas
- Only I could maintain it
- 2-3 weeks per planning cycle

SECTION 2: The Breaking Point
- A business request that could not wait
- The weekend that changed everything
- "There has to be a better way"

SECTION 3: The Build Journey
- Starting with the core algorithm
- Python optimizer (17ms execution)
- Desktop app for my own use
- Validation against the old spreadsheet

SECTION 4: The Validation
- Side-by-side comparison
- Same data, same answers (but 1000x faster)
- Adding features I always wished I had
- Scenario analysis becomes trivial

SECTION 5: The Scale Question
- Other plants have the same problem
- Survey of 20-30 global IEs
- Universal pain, zero existing solutions
- Market opportunity

SECTION 6: Lessons Learned
- The transition is data migration, not process change
- Speed enables new behaviors
- You already have what you need

CONCLUSION
The best time to migrate was 10 years ago. The second best time is now.

Subject: Your [Resource Name] is ready

Hi [First Name],

Thanks for downloading [Resource Name]. Here is your link:

[DOWNLOAD BUTTON]

While you have it open, here is the one thing I hope you take away:

[One key insight from the resource - 2-3 sentences]

Over the next couple of weeks, I will share a few things that
complement what you just downloaded. Nothing salesy - just
practical insights from 13 years of capacity planning in
automotive manufacturing.

Talk soon,
Aaron Zapata
Founder, Line Optimizer

P.S. If you have a burning capacity planning question, just reply
to this email. I read every response.

**Email 2: Problem Framing (Day 3)**

```
Subject: The $2M spreadsheet problem

Hi [First Name],

Here is a quick story.

A few years ago, I calculated how much time I spent on capacity
planning spreadsheets. The answer: about 200 hours per year.

At a fully-loaded IE cost of $75/hour, that is $15,000. Multiply
by 10 plants in my region, and you have $150,000 in direct labor.

But here is the real cost: How many scenarios did we NOT run
because it would take another 8 hours each? How many decisions
did we delay waiting for analysis? How much business did we turn
away because we were not sure if we could handle it?

That is the $2M problem. Not the spreadsheet itself - but what
the spreadsheet prevents you from doing.

[Read: The Hidden Cost of Spreadsheet-Based Capacity Planning]

Aaron

P.S. I wrote this article to break down the full cost. It is not
fun reading, but it is honest.
```

---

**Email 3: Solution Introduction (Day 7)**

```
Subject: What if capacity planning took 17 milliseconds?

Hi [First Name],

Quick question: How long does it take to run one capacity scenario?

For most plants, the answer is 4-8 hours. Which means you run
maybe 2-3 scenarios per year.

What if you could run a scenario in 17 milliseconds?

That is not a typo. That is what happens when you move from
formulas that calculate sequentially to an algorithm designed
for this specific problem.

At that speed, something changes. You stop thinking about
scenarios as "big projects" and start thinking about them as
"questions you can answer in a meeting."

"What if we win this program?" Click. Answer.
"What if volume goes up 20%?" Click. Answer.
"What if we add a third shift?" Click. Answer.

That is what Line Optimizer does. Not because the algorithm is
magic - but because it was built by someone who spent 13 years
wishing this existed.

**Email 4: Social Proof (Day 10)**

```
Subject: From 4 hours to 4 minutes (a real story)

Hi [First Name],

I want to share a quick story from a plant manager I showed
Line Optimizer to last month.

His reaction after the demo:

"So you are telling me that what takes my IE 4 hours every time
sales asks 'can we make this work' - that same analysis would
take 4 minutes? Including the time to set up the scenario?"

Yes. Actually, the calculation takes 17 milliseconds. The 4 minutes
is for the human to look at the data and click the button.

His next question: "Why does everyone use Excel if this exists?"

The honest answer: Because until recently, it did not exist.
Siemens and SAP sell platforms that cost $500K and take a year
to implement. For most plants, that is not an option.

Line Optimizer exists because I got tired of waiting for someone
else to build it.

If any of that resonated, I would love to show you Line Optimizer.

It is a 30-minute demo. I will use your data if you want (or
sample data if you prefer). No slides - just the actual tool.

[Schedule a Demo]

If now is not the right time, no worries. I will keep sending
occasional insights that I hope you find valuable.

But if you are curious what modern capacity planning looks like -
let us find 30 minutes.

**Email 2: Addressing Common Concerns (Day 3)**

```
Subject: A few things I should have mentioned

Hi [First Name],

After our demo, I realized I did not fully address a few things
that usually come up:

**"How long does implementation take?"**
Most plants are up and running in 1-2 weeks. The longest part
is usually getting data out of existing systems - once that is
done, setup is straightforward.

**"What about our existing spreadsheet data?"**
Line Optimizer imports directly from Excel. Your existing data
(lines, models, compatibilities, volumes) can be imported in
one step.

**"Who else needs to be involved in this decision?"**
I am happy to do another demo for [IT / Plant Manager / Finance]
if that would help. Usually takes 20-30 minutes.

Let me know if any of these are on your mind - or if there is
something else I should address.

Aaron
```

---

**Email 3: Decision Push (Day 7)**

```
Subject: Quick question

Hi [First Name],

I wanted to check in on your thinking after our demo last week.

A few options, depending on where you are:

1. **Ready to move forward** - Let us set up your account and
   get you started. [Start Trial]

2. **Need more information** - Happy to schedule a follow-up
   call or answer questions via email.

3. **Not the right time** - Totally understand. I will check
   back in [3 months / next quarter].

4. **Not a fit** - Also fine. Let me know and I will stop
   following up.

Just a quick reply with a number (1, 2, 3, or 4) helps me
understand how to help.

**Email 2: Industry Update (Day 7)**

```
Subject: What I am seeing in capacity planning right now

Hi [First Name],

Quick industry update based on conversations with 20+ IEs
over the past few months:

1. [Trend 1 - e.g., "EV programs are breaking traditional
   capacity models"]

2. [Trend 2 - e.g., "More plants are moving to monthly
   planning cycles"]

3. [Trend 3 - e.g., "Changeover is getting more attention
   as mix increases"]

Any of these resonate with what you are seeing?

I am always curious how different plants are handling these
challenges. If you have a few minutes for a call, I would
love to learn what is working for you.

Aaron
```

## Appendix: Content Tone and Voice Guidelines

### Do

- **Be direct and practical** - IEs appreciate straight talk
- **Use industry terminology** - They know OEE, takt time, and changeover
- **Include specific numbers** - "17 milliseconds" not "very fast"
- **Acknowledge complexity** - Manufacturing is hard; do not oversimplify
- **Share genuine insights** - Original thinking, not recycled content
- **Write in active voice** - "The optimizer calculates" not "Calculations are made"
- **Use short paragraphs** - Scannable for busy readers
- **Include examples** - Real scenarios resonate

### Do Not

- **Use corporate buzzwords** - "Synergy," "paradigm shift," "leverage"
- **Oversimplify** - These are technical professionals
- **Make unsubstantiated claims** - Back up assertions with data
- **Sound like every other software vendor** - Authentic voice matters
- **Ignore manufacturing realities** - Changeover is messy, data is imperfect
- **Use excessive exclamation points** - Professionals do not need hype
- **Add filler words** - Every sentence should add value

### Voice Examples

**Too Corporate:**
"Leveraging our innovative capacity optimization platform enables
manufacturing excellence through synergistic digital transformation."

**Too Casual:**
"This tool is super awesome and will totally change how you work!"

**Just Right:**
"Line Optimizer calculates capacity scenarios in 17 milliseconds.
That speed changes how you approach planning - instead of running
three scenarios per year, you can run three per meeting."
