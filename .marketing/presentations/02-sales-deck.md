## SLIDE 3: The Reality of Capacity Planning Today

### Does This Sound Familiar?

**Monday:** Customer asks "Can you take 50K more units of Model X?"

**Tuesday:** Open Excel... hunt for the capacity model... find "Final_v3_REAL_final.xlsx"

**Wednesday:** Update assumptions, fix broken formulas, wait for recalculation

**Thursday:** "Here's a preliminary answer... but I didn't include changeover time"

**Friday:** Decision already made without the analysis

**The real cost isn't the analysis time. It's the decisions made without analysis.**

---

## SLIDE 4: The Hidden Costs

### What You're Actually Paying

| Problem | Annual Impact |
|---------|---------------|
| IE time in spreadsheets (20 hrs/week) | $50,000+ in labor |
| Wrong capacity commitments | $50-200K in expedited freight |
| Lost quotes (too slow to respond) | $100K-1M in missed business |
| Changeover ignored | 10-20% capacity overstated |

> **Question for you:** What did the last capacity miss cost your plant?

---

## SLIDE 5: There's a Better Way

### Introducing Line Optimizer

**Purpose-built capacity planning for manufacturing engineers**

| Excel Reality | Line Optimizer |
|---------------|----------------|
| Hours per analysis | **17 milliseconds** |
| One scenario at a time | **Instant comparison** |
| Changeover ignored or guessed | **Probability-weighted calculation** |
| One person knows the formulas | **Anyone can use it** |
| Version chaos | **Single source of truth** |

---

## SLIDE 6: How It Works

### Simple Workflow, Powerful Results

```
1. IMPORT           2. VISUALIZE         3. ANALYZE          4. DECIDE
Your existing   →   Interactive      →   17ms algorithm  →   Compare
Excel data          production           runs instantly      scenarios
                    canvas
```

**No IT project. No consultants. Productive in days.**

## SLIDE 7: Key Capabilities

### Built for Real Manufacturing Complexity

| Feature | What It Does | Why It Matters |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| **Multi-Sheet Excel Import** | Lines, Models, Volumes, Changeover | Your data works, no re-entry |
| **Three-Tier Changeover** | Global → Family → Line resolution | 50 entries cover 400+ combinations |
| **Changeover as Constraint** | Reduces available capacity | "85% becomes 108% with changeover" |
| **DAG-Based Routing** | Parallel process flows | Models real manufacturing |
| **Multi-Year Navigation** | See 2026, 2027, 2028 | Know when constraints emerge |
| **Constraint Detection** | Automatic bottleneck identification | Know exactly what to fix |

---

## SLIDE 8: The Changeover Difference

### Most Tools Ignore Changeover. We Calculate It Properly.

**Traditional approach:**
> "Assume zero changeover" or "Add 10% buffer"

**Line Optimizer approach:**
> Proprietary probability-weighted algorithm based on your actual demand mix

**Why it matters:**
- An 80/10/10 demand mix has FEWER changeovers than 33/33/33
- Simple averages get this wrong
- We reduce available capacity, not just show a number

---

## SLIDE 9: Three-Tier Changeover Resolution

### Enter 50 Values, Cover 400+ Combinations

| Priority | Level | Example | When Used |
|----------|-------|---------|-----------|
| 1 (Highest) | Line Override | SMT-1: A→B = 45 min | Specific exceptions |
| 2 | Family Default | Family A → Family B = 30 min | Most transitions |
| 3 (Fallback) | Global Default | Everything else = 30 min | Catch-all |

**Result:** Realistic changeover modeling without data entry nightmare.

## SLIDE 10: Live Demo

### Let's See Line Optimizer in Action

**I'll show you:**
1. How fast the analysis runs (17ms)
2. What happens when you toggle changeover ON
3. How constraint detection works
4. Multi-year navigation

## SLIDE 11: Demo Moment 1 - Speed

### Watch the Execution Time

> "I'm going to click Run Analysis. Watch the timer."
>
> [Clicks button]
>
> "17 milliseconds. Not 17 seconds. Your IE can run 100 scenarios in the time Excel runs one."

---

## SLIDE 12: Demo Moment 2 - Changeover Toggle

### The Difference Between Theoretical and Realistic Capacity

> "This line shows 85% utilization. Looks healthy, right?"
>
> [Clicks "Changeover: All ON"]
>
> "Now it's 108%. That blue bar is production. That amber bar is changeover time. You're already over capacity—you just didn't know it."

**This is why capacity commitments fail.**

---

## SLIDE 13: Demo Moment 3 - Constraint Detection

### Know Exactly What's Limiting You

> "See this indicator? It's not just saying 'over capacity.'
>
> It's telling you this is a **dedicated line bottleneck** vs. a **shared capacity constraint**.
>
> Different problems need different solutions. Line Optimizer tells you which one you have."

---

## SLIDE 14: Demo Moment 4 - Multi-Year

### See When Constraints Emerge

> "Click 2026... looks fine, 78% average utilization.
>
> Click 2027... still OK.
>
> Click 2028... Final Assembly hits 102%.
>
> You now have two years to add capacity, negotiate volume, or make other plans. Not two weeks of panic."

## SLIDE 15: ROI Analysis

### The Numbers Make Sense

| Investment | Return |
|------------|--------|
| Line Optimizer: $15-30K/year | IE time savings: $37,500/year |
| | Faster decisions: $50K+/year value |
| | Avoided mistakes: $100K+/year |

**Payback: 3-4 months**

> Your IE spends 800-1000 hours/year on capacity analysis.
> What else could they do with that time?

---

## SLIDE 16: Implementation Timeline
