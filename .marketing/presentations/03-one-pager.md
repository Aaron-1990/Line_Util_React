# LINE OPTIMIZER
## Capacity Answers in Minutes, Not Days

---

### The Problem

Industrial Engineers spend **20+ hours per week** building capacity models in Excel.

When someone asks "Can we take this new program?" the answer takes **days, not minutes**.

And that answer **ignores changeover time**, which means capacity is overstated by 10-20%.

---

### The Solution

**Line Optimizer** is a desktop capacity planning tool built by an Industrial Engineer with 13 years at BorgWarner.

| Capability | How It Helps |
|------------|--------------|
| **17ms analysis** | Run 100 scenarios in the time Excel runs 1 |
| **Three-tier changeover** | Global → Family → Line resolution (50 entries cover 400+ combinations) |
| **Changeover as constraint** | Reduces available capacity—"85% becomes 108% with changeover" |
| **DAG-based routing** | Parallel process flows: SMT → [ICT \|\| Conformal] → Assembly |
| **Multi-year navigation** | See when constraints emerge (2026 OK, 2028 red) |
| **Constraint detection** | Know if it's a dedicated line bottleneck vs. shared capacity issue |

---

### The Technical Difference

**Most tools ignore changeover. We calculate it properly.**

| Approach | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Simple average | Treats all transitions equally (WRONG) |
| Line Optimizer | Proprietary algorithm weights by your actual demand mix |

**Example:** An 80/10/10 demand split has FEWER changeovers than 33/33/33. Simple averages miss this. We don't.

**And changeover reduces capacity, not just displays a number.**

### The ROI

| Your Investment | Your Return |
|-----------------|-------------|
| $15-30K/year | IE time savings: $37,500/year |
| | Avoided expedite costs: $50,000+/year |
| | Better capital decisions: priceless |

**Payback: 3-4 months**

### How It Works

```
1. IMPORT your existing Excel data (Lines, Models, Volumes, Changeover)
2. VISUALIZE your production layout on an interactive canvas
3. ANALYZE with our validated algorithm (17 milliseconds)
4. DECIDE with confidence using multi-year constraint visibility
```

**No IT project. No consultants. Productive in days.**

---

### Who It's For

| User | Primary Benefit |
|------|-----------------|
| **Industrial Engineers** | Stop wrestling with spreadsheets. Get trusted answers fast. |
| **Plant Managers** | Commit capacity with confidence. Justify investments with data. |
| **Corporate Planning** | Standard methodology across plants. Quote new business in hours. |

**This is strategic capacity planning, not shop floor execution.**
