## Key Messages

### Primary Value Proposition

> **"Line Optimizer gives manufacturing engineers the power to answer capacity questions in minutes, not days - with the confidence that comes from validated algorithms, not spreadsheet guesswork."**

### Tagline Options

- "Capacity answers in minutes, not days" (recommended)
- "Stop guessing. Start knowing."
- "The capacity planning tool IEs actually use."

### Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

> "I spent 13 years doing capacity planning at BorgWarner. Every plant I worked with had the same problem: IEs spending 20 hours a week in Excel, delivering answers that took days and were probably wrong.
>
> I built Line Optimizer to fix that. It's a desktop tool that gives you capacity answers in minutes instead of days, with an algorithm you can actually trust.
>
> Would you be interested in seeing how it works?"
