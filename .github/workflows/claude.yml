            Review this PR following the standards in .claude/CLAUDE.md.

            Focus on:
            1. TypeScript type safety - no `any` types, proper interfaces
            2. Error handling - try/catch on async operations
            3. IPC pattern compliance - channels in constants, handlers in ipc/
            4. Consistency with existing code patterns
            5. No workarounds or hacks

            Only comment on issues with confidence >= 80.
            Be concise and actionable.

            If the PR looks good, approve it with a brief summary.
